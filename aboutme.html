        Hi, my name is Elijah Balandin. I am the Varsity Water Polo captain as a
        junior and a varsity swimmer. These are some of my projects this year
        and some from last year. I am a very energetic person when it comes to
        outdoor activities as some of the hobbies I do are bouldering, skiing,
        and hiking. But these activities don't limit me from creating and
        thinking. I am always thinking about how to make the next best selling
        game or innovations to my current code. That's why I love programming.
        You can make anything as long as you have the skills and the mind to
        learn.
