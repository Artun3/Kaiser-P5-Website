            drawing app
          </a>
          The Drawing app v1 was also a great challenge to code. 
          The major struggle for me was that I am so used to making games and robots that an app was so out of my comfort zone. 
          Eventually I related the drawing app to something like a game menu and from there I took off. 
          The actual paint brush was the easiest of the tools. The menu and knowing how to cancel the paint brush simultaneously was a challenge at first but it eventually came with ease. 
          The other tools so far have had to be outside the menu to complete the V1 requirements. But I have big aspirations for the menu in version 2.0.

          Scratch Game
        </a>
        Last year's final. One of my best scratch games. It is a horror game made from scratch.It used an immense amount of code to complete. The hardest part about the game had to be merging everyone's ideas together, making the boundaries for each level, and coding every button, door and way to move.

      <h2>Make Block Final</h2>
      <p>
The Make block robot final was a great success. Along with the Itchy Itchiford team we created a soccer beast. The main goal of the robot was to have folding wings that could be sent out and in for out choosing. We also had to modify the robot's original design. We made it smaller, taller and wider. This helped in movement and stability whilst driving. We also raised the brain and battery to give room for the wings.
